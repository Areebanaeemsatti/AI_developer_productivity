# Developer Productivity Predictor ☕💻

An interactive **Gradio app** that predicts whether a developer will have a productive day based on inputs like **coffee intake**, **coding hours**, **AI usage**, **distractions**, and more. Built using **Python**, **Pandas**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Gradio**.

---

## 🚀 Motivation

As a developer, I often wondered what factors influence my productivity. The first thing that came to mind? **Coffee!** ☕
This project explores how variables like caffeine, sleep, cognitive load, and AI tools impact developer success.

## 🛠️ Technologies & Tools

* **Python** 🐍
* **Pandas, NumPy** 📊
* **Scikit-learn** 🤖
* **Gradio** 🖥️ (for UI)
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn** (for insights visualization)

---

## 📂 Features

* **Predict Task Success** using a trained Random Forest model
* **Interactive Plots** showing relationships between variables (e.g., Coffee vs. Commits)
* **Categorization** of coffee intake levels (Low, Medium, High)
* **Multiple Tabs UI** for accuracy, visual insights, and predictions

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Data**: Loaded from a CSV of developer metrics
2. **Feature Engineering**: Includes interaction terms and coffee level categorization
3. **Model**: Random Forest Classifier trained on key productivity indicators
4. **Frontend**: Built with Gradio's `TabbedInterface` for seamless UX

## 💡 Future Improvements

* Add model comparison (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)
* Support for live data tracking via browser extension
* Deploy on Hugging Face Spaces or Streamlit Cloud
